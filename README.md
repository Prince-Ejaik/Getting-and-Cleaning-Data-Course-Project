# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This submission is a requirement for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has, among other things, the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset. 
Data was obtained from: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
Dataset for the project sourced from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

•	CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the dataset, and the corresponding work that I did in order to clean up the dataset.
•	run_analysis.R most importantly prepares the dataset and then carries out the following steps as outlined in the project instructions:
o	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
o	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
o	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
o	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
o	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
•	Indepedendet_Dataset is the exported data after carrying out all the steps outlined above.
